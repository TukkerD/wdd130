    <p>Hey hey! My name is Tukker and I am excited to do some <b><i>HTML!</b></i> Thats all I got, fancy right? </p>
    <p>
    I am from Bakersfield, CA but I have been living in Rexburg for 3/4 years. Its nice to not breathe in smog 24/7. I am married to my beautiful wife Jesse and have two awesome kids. I enjoy playing video games, marvel rivals is my new obsession, with my wife and we are also into board games. We have decent collection.

    As of right now, I am a Cybersecurity major. This is my 3rd degree change during school so hopefully it sticks this time! I have always liked computers since I was a kid and fortunately I still do so it made sense.
