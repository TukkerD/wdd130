                <h2>Network Vulnerability Assessment</h2>
                <p>
                    In this project, I conducted a vulnerability assessment on a small business network using tools like Nmap and Nessus. 
                    I identified open ports, outdated software, and misconfigurations that could be exploited by attackers. 
                    After the assessment, I provided recommendations for patching vulnerabilities and improving the network's security posture.

                <h2>Phishing Awareness Campaign</h2>
                <p>
                    I designed and implemented a phishing awareness campaign for a small organization. This included creating simulated phishing emails 
                    to test employee awareness and conducting training sessions on how to identify and report phishing attempts. 
                    The campaign resulted in a 30% reduction in successful phishing attempts within the organization.

            <h2>Why These Projects Matter</h2>
            <p>
                These projects demonstrate my ability to apply intermediate-level cybersecurity skills in real-world scenarios. 
                From identifying network vulnerabilities to improving organizational security through employee training, 
                I focus on practical solutions that make a measurable impact. These experiences have prepared me to tackle more complex 
                challenges as I continue to grow in the field of cybersecurity.
